# TODO 

In priority order (proof of concept):

 Make list of exercises / sets for one pull. Possible ways: CHECK
 - Exercise node, contains name, maxset, weight, pointer to next exercise node?
 - Classobject that has name, maxset, weight. Put in array with rest of exercises for day? CHECK
 - Text string magic (check first char in string for maxset, grab weight from file, array of string exercise names?


Read/write to saved file for weights. FUNCTIONAL CHECK - add for all exercises

Fix all weight settings (maybe only compounds?)

Add weight option after completed exercise
 
Read/write for which pull/push variant? - CHECK

Repeat for push and legs. (superclass good idea)
